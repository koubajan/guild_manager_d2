# Guild Master

We have recently talked about ERP systems in our Economics classes and I thought why not create a RPG ERP system.
This is a desktop application for managing an RPG Guild. It allows you to create heroes, manage their inventory, edit the game's item database (shop), and generate reports.

It demonstrates the **Active Record** design pattern, **MySQL** database integration, and **Tkinter** GUI.

## How to Set Up on a New PC

Follow these steps to get the app running on a different computer (e.g., school PC).
Note: the folder data_samples contains the templates for importing data

### 1. Requirements
* **Python 3.x** installed.
* **MySQL Server** (I used MySQL Workbench) running.

### 2. Installation
1.  Download or clone this repository.
2.  Open a terminal/command prompt in the project folder.
3.  Install the required library:
    ```bash
    pip install mysql-connector-python
    ```

### 3. Database Setup
1.  Open your database manager.
2.  Create a new database (e.g., `guild_master_db`).
3.  Import the SQL script located in:
    * `sql/db_schema.sql` (or `import.sql`)
    * *This will create all necessary tables and views.*

### 4. Configuration (IMPORTANT)
The application **will not work** immediately because the configuration file with passwords is hidden (via `.gitignore`) for security (the original config.json IS MINE). You must create your own.

1.  Look for the file named `config.sample.json` in the main folder.
2.  **Rename it** to `config.json` (or make a copy named `config.json`).
3.  Open `config.json` in a text editor and fill in your database login details:
    ```json
    {
        "host": "localhost",
        "user": "root",       <-- Change if needed
        "password": "",       <-- Put your DB password here
        "database": "guild_master_db" <-- Or lit anything you put in while creating this
    }
    ```

### 5. Running the App
Run the main script from the terminal:
```bash
python src/main.py
